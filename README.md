# Welcome!

If you aim to become a back-end web developer, you're in the right place. This guide outlines the essential steps and considerations for starting your journey.

## 1. Learn the Basics of Front-End Development

Before diving into back-end development, it's crucial to understand the basics of front-end technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Why Learn Front-End Basics?
- **Understanding User Experience (UX):** Knowing how users interact with the front-end helps you create more efficient and user-friendly back-end systems.
- **Structure Insight:** Grasping the structure of web pages aids in designing better data flow and integration.

## 2. Choose Your Back-End Technology

There are numerous programming languages and frameworks you can use for back-end development. Here are some popular ones:
- **JavaScript:** Node.js
- **Python:** Django, Flask
- **C#:** ASP.NET Core
- **PHP:** Laravel
- **Java**
- **Go**
- **Ruby**

### How to Choose?
- **Your Knowledge:** If you're already familiar with a language, start with its associated framework.
- **Project Requirements:**
  1. **Client or Team Preference:** Ask your client or team which technology they prefer.
  2. **Research:** Look up similar projects on StackOverflow, GitHub, and other documentation to see what technologies they use and the problems they encountered.
  3. **Considerations:**
     - Scalability
     - Performance
     - Security
     - Hosting Requirements
     - Libraries and Frameworks (depend on plan or Strategy)

## 3. Planning Your Project

### Steps to Take:
1. **Define the Idea:** Clearly outline the features your project must have.
2. **Research:** Check out similar projects for inspiration and potential features.
3. **Consult Experts:** If your project is business-related, get input from Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).
4. **Data Collection:** Determine what data you need from users and its format (e.g., a 6-digit ID).
5. **Feature and Page Planning:** List all necessary features and pages (e.g., Home, Contact, Products, About Us, Product Details).
6. **Feature Breakdown:** Subdivide features into smaller, manageable tasks.
7. **Dependency Mapping:** Identify dependencies between features to create an implementation order.

## 4. Designing the Project

### Strategy and Scenario Planning:
- Outline how the project will function.
- Design the database using Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams and convert them into relational schemas.

## 5. Building the Front-End

- You can either:
  - Develop it yourself.
  - Use a template and customize it.
  - Utilize AI tools for assistance.

## 6. Developing the Back-End

### Suggested Structure:
1. **Create a Main Server File:** This will be the entry point of your application.
2. **Organize Folders:**
   - **Public:** For scripts, CSS, and images.
   - **DB:** Contains configuration, connection files, and a models folder for database schemas.
   - **Controllers:** For handling business logic.
   - **Views:** For templates if you're using server-side rendering.
